        <h2>General Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
            Cooking can be dangerous. It is your responsibility to conduct yourself safely in a kitchen. I am not responsible for how you behave
            in the kitchen. It is a good idea to measure the temperature of your meat with a meat thermometer. It is a good idea to look at the FDA's
            meat, poultry, and seafood temperature guide. You can get really sick from consuming undercooked meat. You can get really sick from contaminating
            an open wound with meat. Be careful in the kitchen and remember that you're responsible for your own safety.

        <h2>What kind of equipment do I need to cook?</h2>
        <p>
            MOST people only need a oven with stove top burners and a few small pieces of equipment. I would recommend getting a pasta strainger,
            a rice strainer, a large pot, a large skillet or pan, a cutting board, and a good knife. You do not need to go out and spend a bunch of 
            money on cooking equipment to make nice meals. There are some cool things out there like sous vide, but you really do not need to spend that 
            much money when you can do pretty much everything with an over and burners. The only thing "extra" I would recommend is a cast iron skillet
            if you have the extra money, but it is not essential.

        <h2>I made a dish but it turned out... bad?!</h2>
        <p>
            You will probably never make a dish for the first time and have it come out great. Assess what was bad about the dish you made and see 
            if there is anything you can change next time to make it better. Did you overcook the meat and make it dry and tough? Did you undercook the rice 
            and now you have crunchy rice? Assess what went wrong and try again, or just try making something else until your skill develope more.

        <h2>I want to cook but he ingredients are expensive!</h2>
        <p>
            Try shopping around. There are some grocery stores that charge a ridiculous amount of money for meat. There are some grocery stores that
            charge a ridiculous amount for rice and vegtables. Just try shopping around, and don't jump on the first thing you see.

    <div class="QA">
        <h2>Why cook when I can just go to a restaurant!?</h2>
        <p>
            Restaurants are USUALLY extremely unhealthy and way too expensive for what they are. A pack of chicken breast and rice from my 
            local grocery store would cost me under $15. That pack of chicken breast and rice can feed me for a couple of days, and isn't pumped full 
            of preservatives and chemicals. Your standard meal at a fast food chain costs around $10 and is full of chemicals. I know it sounds like
            an appeal to nature, but seriously, you should consider cutting down on putting chemicals in your body.

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            This website was created for CS2100, Introduction to Web Development, at University of West Georgia. The website is our project
            that spans the entire semester. This website will be pushed to Github and made publically availible.

        <h2>Concept</h2>
        <p>
            This is a concept website for a recipe website that isn't filled with advertisements, JavaScript, and needless stories (bloat).
            Most recipe websites that populate the first page of search results on Google are very painful to use. They are filled with the
            aforementioned bloat. If you run to the store and realize you need a quick ingredient list or recipe, you dont want advertisements
            that span length of your phone, you don't want a webpage that takes forever to load, and you certainly don't want a story about how
            the authors grandma made this dish when they were and child. Maybe you do, but I just want to be in and out of the store, or at home
            pulling up the recipee and ready to cook in a couple of seconds.

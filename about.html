        <h2>Brevity Cooking</h2>
        <p>
            This is a concept website for a recipe website that isn't filled with advertisements, JavaScript, and needless stories (bloat).
            Most recipe websites that populate the first page of search results on Google are very painful to use. They are filled with the
            aforementioned bloat. If you run to the store and realize you need a quick ingredient list or recipe, you dont want advertisements
            that span the length of your phone, you don't want a webpage that takes forever to load, and you certainly don't want a story about how
            the authors grandma made this dish when they were a child. Maybe you do, but I just want to be in and out of the store, or at home
            pulling up the recipee and ready to cook in a couple of seconds.

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            This website is a project for my class, Introduction to Web Development, at the University of West Georgia. The University
            of West Georgia's computer science classes have been excellent. Since I had some experience with programming before I attended,
            I was blown away by how much I have learned in just a few classes. The professors are always willing to help, and there is a lot
            of camaraderie among the computer science students. Check out the video below to get an idea about West Georgia's computer science
            facilities.
